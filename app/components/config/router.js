// TODO:

// Decide which routes should use StackNavigator(views represented as stack of cards)

// and which should use TabNavigator (tabs within a screen).

// DrawerNavigator(slides out across part of screen from left), Modal(from bottom),

// and custom navigation views also possible but only StackRouter and TabRouter

// included as standard routers. Top level navigators

// accept these props: onNavigationStateChange(prevState, newState, action)
